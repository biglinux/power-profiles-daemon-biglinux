# Power Profiles Daemon Biglinux: Improve Power Management on Your System

The main improvement offered by this add-on is the ability to adjust the processor's "Governor," a function that was not available in the default Power Profiles Daemon.

Additionally, the add-on has been designed to be more compatible with TLP, making it easier to perform advanced power-saving configurations. This makes power management even more efficient and effective.

Power Profiles Daemon Biglinux has also been developed with those whose computers are not directly compatible with the Power Profiles Daemon in mind. With this add-on, power management options will still be displayed and functional, allowing for the Governor to be switched even when the Power Profiles Daemon is not compatible with the hardware in question.

During our tests, we observed a significant reduction in power consumption. However, it's important to note that configuration results may vary depending on the hardware and system usage. In most cases, the performance mode will be faster, but in some situations, the power-saving mode may be more advantageous. For example, when generating less heat, the power-saving mode may be faster than the performance mode in moments that require high processing, as it keeps the processor at a lower temperature.

Try the Power Profiles Daemon Biglinux and optimize your system's power management for the best performance and efficiency!
